component: "My Component"
features: [Feature1, Feature2]

This is a starter template for a metric annotation. The section above is front
matter: we support a free-text "component" and "features" field (the latter is a
list). Note that the above _must_ be specified as valid YAML. See the
[YAML specification](https://yaml.org/spec/) for more details.

You can find more description and context about what to put in for these values
in the
[Data Taxonomy Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpxYdbTzeSX_XU-H09c4xgI7XYFpnMkxu7GFcbKF25E/edit#).

In this section, you can add whatever freeform markdown you think might be
helpful to someone looking at this metric: this could be a set of notes, links
to dashboards or reports which use this metric, or whatever. Bear in mind that
the Glean Dictionary is visible to the public, please do not share information
about Mozilla's partners which is under NDA.
